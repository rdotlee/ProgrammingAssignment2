## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## makeCacheMatrix creates a special matrix object that has a cached inverse associated with it
##   this special matrix object allows for faster recall of an inverse for calculations

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve is used by the makeCacheMatrix function to compute the inverse of a matrix in building a special
##   matrix object that has a cached inverse stored

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
